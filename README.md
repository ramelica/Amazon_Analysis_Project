## Data Pipeline: From Raw Data to Insight

Overview
- The data pipeline starts with raw business data and ends in curated data marts and dashboards.
- Each stage is designed to be idempotent, testable, and tunable for performance.

Source Data Ingestion
- Source variety: sales transactions, product catalog, customer data, promotions, and external market indicators.
- Ingest methods: batch CSV/JSON ingestion, API pulls, and optional streaming for near-real-time needs.
- Data validation: basic checks for required fields, data type conformance, and integrity constraints.

Staging and Cleansing
- Data cleansing rules remove duplicates, fix typographical errors, and standardize formats.
- Common transformations include currency normalization, date normalization, and unit conversions.
- Enrichment steps add derived fields like order month, week, and quarter.

Data Modeling and Storage
- A dimensional model thrives here: a central fact table (sales) with surrounding dimension tables (date, product, customer, store, promotions).
- The model supports fast aggregation and flexible slicing for dashboards.
- Storage options include a relational data warehouse (local or cloud) and a data lake for raw and semi-structured data.

Analytics and Forecasting
- SQL analytics traverse star schemas to compute metrics like gross sales, units sold, average order value, and retention metrics.
- Prophet models forecast demand and revenue by product and region, with confidence intervals.
- ML-enabled analyses may include seasonality detection, customer lifetime value estimation, and anomaly detection.

Dashboards and Visualization
- Power BI dashboards connect to the data warehouse, offering interactive visuals, filters, and drill-throughs.
- Visuals emphasize KPIs, time-series trends, cohort analyses, and product-level performance.
- Dashboards support decision-making for pricing, promotions, and inventory planning.

Cloud and Local Development
- Cloud integration relies on Azure storage and databases to host data and models.
- Azurite provides a local emulation layer for Azure Blob storage and Data Lake features, enabling offline development.
- The pipeline can be run locally or deployed in the cloud, with containerized components (optional) for consistency.

Operational Considerations
- Idempotent runs prevent duplicate data when pipelines re-run.
- Clear logging and monitoring enable quick debugging and performance tuning.
- Data quality checks run at the end of each pipeline to ensure dashboards reflect accurate data.

## Data Model: How Data is Organized

Key dimensions
- Date dimension (calendar attributes, fiscal periods, holidays)
- Product dimension (SKU, category, brand, price, cost)
- Customer dimension (segments, geography, acquisition channel)
- Store or channel dimension (online, mobile, marketplace)

Fact tables
- Sales fact: order_id, date_id, product_id, customer_id, store_id, units_sold, gross_sales, discounts, taxes, shipping_cost, net_sales
- Promotions fact (optional): promo_id, date_id, product_id, impact on sales, discount_amount

Aggregations
- Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly aggregates
- Rolling metrics for moving averages and growth rates
- Cohort-based metrics for customer retention and repeat purchase behaviors

Data quality
- Unique constraints on order_id and product_id in facts
- Referential integrity between facts and dimensions
- Validation checks on value ranges (e.g., unit_price > 0, quantity >= 0)

Schema evolution
- Backward-compatible changes prioritized
- Versioned schemas with migration scripts
- Clear deprecation notices and transition plans

---

## Analytics and Forecasting

SQL analytics
- Build revenue and unit metrics through straightforward joins and group-bys.
- Explore customer behavior with RFM analyses, cohort calculations, and lifetime value estimates.
- Use window functions for running totals, moving averages, and time-based rankings.

Forecasting with Prophet
- Prophet models forecast demand at product, category, or region levels.
- Inputs include historical sales data, promotions, holidays, and external indicators.
- Outputs include forecasted demand, expected revenue, and confidence intervals.
- Model evaluation through cross-validation and back-testing to ensure reliability.

Machine learning
- Features: seasonality indices, promotional intensity, price elasticity proxies, and customer segments.
- Algorithms: linear models, tree-based methods, and clustering for segmentation.
- Evaluation: accuracy for forecasts, RMSE for numeric predictions, and AUC for classification tasks.

Model lifecycle
- Train-test splits aligned with time-based horizons
- Retraining cadence dictated by data volume and business needs
- Deployment via notebooks, scripts, or small services

Use cases
- Inventory planning: align stock with forecasted demand
- Pricing and promotions: simulate impact of price changes
- Market analysis: compare performance across regions and channels
- Customer insights: identify high-value customers and retention drivers

## BI Dashboards and Visualization

Power BI
- Interactive dashboards for executives and managers
- Key visuals include revenue trends, product performance, customer cohorts, and campaign effectiveness
- Filters by date, product category, region, and channel enable deep analysis

Data connections
- Dashboards connect to curated data marts or data warehouses
- DirectQuery and Import modes supported depending on data size and latency requirements
- Scheduled data refreshes keep dashboards up-to-date

Data storytelling
- Dashboards designed to answer concrete business questions
- Clear KPIs and variance indicators help identify opportunities and risks
- Drill-throughs provide context for deeper investigation

Dashboards are designed to be self-explanatory, with tooltips and concise captions. They serve as the primary interface for business users to explore insights without needing to touch raw data.
